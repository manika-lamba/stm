THE POOLED SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY WERE 0.808 (95\\%CI 0.656-0.903) AND 0.920 (95\\%CI 0.769-0.975), RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE NCITS (USING FOREHEAD AS THE SITE OF MEASUREMENT), AND 0.818 (95\\%CI 0.758-0.866) AND 0.923 (95\\%CI 0.823-0.969), RESPECTIVELY, FOR THERMAL SCANNERS. THE SENSITIVITY OF NCITS INCREASED ON USE OF RECTAL TEMPERATURE AS THE REFERENCE. THE SENSITIVITY OF THERMAL SCANNERS DECREASED IN A DISEASE OUTBREAK/PANDEMIC SETTING. CHANGES APPROACHING STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WERE ALSO OBSERVED ON THE EXCLUSION OF NEONATES FROM THE ANALYSIS. THERMAL SCREENING HAD A LOW POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE, ESPECIALLY AT THE INITIAL STAGE OF AN OUTBREAK, WHEREAS THE NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE (NPV) CONTINUED TO BE HIGH EVEN AT LATER STAGES. THERMAL SCREENING HAS REASONABLE DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY IN THE DETECTION OF FEVER, ALTHOUGH IT MAY VARY WITH CHANGES IN SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS, SETTING, INDEX TEST AND THE REFERENCE STANDARD USED. THERMAL SCREENING HAS A GOOD NPV EVEN DURING A PANDEMIC.

THE POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS NOTICEABLE REDUCTION IN PATIENTS WITH ACS/STEMI DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ARE MULTI-FACTORIAL.

METHODS TWO REVIEWERS SEARCHED FOR PUBLISHED AND PRE-PUBLISHED RELEVANT ARTICLES BETWEEN DECEMBER 2019 AND 8 JUNE 2020. THE DATA FROM THE SELECTED STUDIES WERE ABSTRACTED AND ANALYZED FOR EFFICACY AND SAFETY OUTCOMES. CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE EVIDENCE WAS DONE BY COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL AND NEWCASTLE OTTAWA SCALE. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS GRADED AS PER THE GRADE APPROACH. RESULTS WE REVIEWED 12 OBSERVATIONAL AND 3 RANDOMIZED TRIALS WHICH INCLUDED 10,659 PATIENTS OF WHOM 5713 RECEIVED CQ/HCQ AND 4966 RECEIVED ONLY STANDARD OF CARE. THE EFFICACY OF CQ/HCQ FOR COVID-19 WAS INCONSISTENT ACROSS THE STUDIES. META-ANALYSIS OF INCLUDED STUDIES REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MORTALITY WITH HCQ USE [RR 0.98 95\\% CI 0.66-1.46], TIME TO FEVER RESOLUTION (MEAN DIFFERENCE - 0.54 DAYS (- 1.19-011)) OR CLINICAL DETERIORATION/DEVELOPMENT OF ARDS WITH HCQ [RR 0.90 95\\% CI 0.47-1.71]. THERE WAS A HIGHER RISK OF ECG ABNORMALITIES/ARRHYTHMIA WITH HCQ/CQ [RR 1.46 95\\% CI 1.04 TO 2.06]. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS GRADED AS VERY LOW FOR THESE OUTCOMES.

RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF PATIENTS WAS 45.8 12.7 YEARS; 17 (70.8%) WERE MALES; UPPER GI (UGI) BLEEDING: LOWER GI (LGI) 23:1. TWENTY-TWO (91.6%) PATIENTS HAD EVIDENCE OF CIRRHOSIS- 21 PRESENTED WITH UGI BLEEDING WHILE ONE HAD BLEEDING FROM HEMORRHOIDS. TWO PATIENTS WITHOUT CIRRHOSIS WERE PRESUMED TO HAVE NON-VARICEAL BLEEDING. THE MEDICAL THERAPY FOR UGI BLEEDING INCLUDED VASOCONSTRICTORS-SOMATOSTATIN IN 17 (73.9%) AND TERLIPRESSIN IN 4 (17.4%) PATIENTS. ALL PATIENTS WITH UGI BLEEDING RECEIVED PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS AND ANTIBIOTICS. PACKED RED BLOOD CELLS (PRBCS), FRESH FROZEN PLASMA (FFPS) AND PLATELETS WERE TRANSFUSED IN 14 (60.9%), 3 (13.0%) AND 3 (13.0%), RESPECTIVELY. THE MEDIAN PRBCS TRANSFUSED WAS 1 (03) UNIT(S). THE INITIAL CONTROL OF UGI BLEEDING WAS ACHIEVED IN ALL 23 PATIENTS AND NONE REQUIRED AN EMERGENCY ENDOSCOPY. AT 5-DAY FOLLOW-UP, NONE REBLED OR DIED. TWO PATIENTS LATER REBLED, ONE HAD INTERMITTENT BLEED DUE TO GASTRIC ANTRAL VASCULAR ECTASIA, WHILE ANOTHER HAD REBLEED 19 DAYS AFTER DISCHARGE. THREE (12.5%) CIRRHOSIS PATIENTS SUCCUMBED TO ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE DURING HOSPITAL STAY. CONCLUSION: CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES INCLUDING PHARMACOTHERAPY, RESTRICTIVE TRANSFUSION STRATEGY, AND CLOSE HEMODYNAMIC MONITORING CAN SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE GI BLEEDING IN COVID-19 PATIENTS AND REDUCE NEED FOR URGENT ENDOSCOPY. THE DECISION FOR PROCEEDING WITH ENDOSCOPY SHOULD BE TAKEN BY A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM AFTER CONSIDERATION OF THE PATIENT'S CONDITION, RESPONSE TO TREATMENT, RESOURCES AND THE RISKS INVOLVED, ON A CASE TO CASE BASIS. 2020 INDIAN NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR STUDY OF THE LIVER","PY":"2020","AU":"SHALIMAR S;VAISHNAV M;ELHENCE A;KUMAR R;MOHTA S;PALLE C;KUMAR P;RANJAN M;VAJPAI T;PRASAD S;YEGURLA J;DHOORIA A;BANYAL V;AGARWAL S;BANSAL R;BHATTACHARJEE S;AGGARWAL R;SONI K;RUDRAVARAM S;SINGH A;ALTAF I;CHOUDEKAR A;MAHAPATRA S;GUNJAN D;KEDIA S;MAKHARIA G;TRIKHA A;GARG P;SARAYA A","TI":"OUTCOME OF CONSERVATIVE THERAPY IN CORONAVIRUS DISEASE2019 PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING","Topic 1":0.0363920348279981,"Topic 2":0.000833057395050356,"Topic 3":0.00248827503808984,"Topic 4":0.00544563413993751,"Topic 5":0.00250217529047129,"Topic 6":0.000459381770606334,"Topic 7":0.00560571921875761,"Topic 8":0.939853304430186,"Topic 9":0.00373121119801159,"Topic 10":0.00268920669089149},{"id":60,"body":"OBJECTIVE: KNOWLEDGE ABOUT COVID-19 IN CHILDREN IS LIMITED DUE TO THE PAUCITY OF REPORTED DATA.

HENCE, WE PLANNED TO SYNTHESIZE THE CURRENT DATA THAT WILL HELP IN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF COVID-19 IN CHILDREN. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: FOUR DIFFERENT ELECTRONIC DATABASES (MEDLINE, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, AND CENTRAL) WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES RELATED TO COVID-19 IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION. WE INCLUDED STUDIES REPORTING DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES OF COVID-19 IN PATIENTS AGED LESS THAN 19 YEARS. WE PERFORMED A RANDOM-EFFECT META-ANALYSIS TO PROVIDE POOLED ESTIMATES OF VARIOUS DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS. RESULTS: 27 STUDIES (4857 PATIENTS) FULFILLING THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WERE INCLUDED IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, FROM A TOTAL OF 883 RECORDS. ABOUT HALF OF THE PATIENTS HAD EACH OF FEVER AND COUGH, 11% (617%) HAD FAST BREATHING, AND 613% HAD GASTROINTESTINAL MANIFESTATIONS. MOST OF THE PATIENTS HAD MILD TO MODERATE DISEASE, AND ONLY 4% HAD A SEVERE OR CRITICAL ILLNESS. LEUKOPENIA WAS THE COMMONEST REPORTED LABORATORY ABNORMALITY. CONCLUSION: EVEN AMONG THE SYMPTOMATIC COVID-19 CASES, SEVERE MANIFESTATIONS ARE SEEN IN VERY FEW CHILDREN.

THE DATA FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS WAS EXTRACTED WHERE AVAILABLE FROM PUBLISHED REPORTS INCLUDING CLINICAL AND LABORATORY PARAMETERS AND ANALYSED FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN VARIABLES. RESULTS WE IDENTIFIED 30 RELEVANT ARTICLES INVOLVING 115 PATIENTS WITH ACUTE OR SUBACUTE STROKE WITH COVID-19. THE MEAN +/- STANDARD DEVIATION AGE WAS 62.5 +/- 14.5 YEARS. STROKE WAS ISCHEMIC IN MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS (101 [87.8\\%]). HYPERTENSION (42 [42\\%]), DYSLIPIDAEMIA (24 [26.1\\%]), AND DIABETES (23 [23.2\\%]) WERE THE MAJOR VASCULAR RISK FACTORS.

SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES HAVE BEEN DEDICATED TO THE DISEASE. THE PANDEMIC IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT, COMPARED WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD, IS RELATIVELY DELAYED. THE NEUROSURGICAL PRACTICE CANNOT REMAIN UNAFFECTED BY HUGELY DISRUPTIVE MEASURES SUCH AS A LOCKDOWN. THE INEVITABLE INCREASE IN COVID INFECTIONS WITH THE GRADUAL RELAXATION OF LOCKDOWN CONTINUES TO POSE A RISK FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD A DISCERNIBLE EFFECT ON HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF PRACTICE MODIFICATIONS IN PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS AND PUBLICLY FUNDED HOSPITALS, THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT ON THE SURGEON, AND THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON THE PSYCHE OF THE SURGEON. METHODS: AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY WAS PREPARED, WITH QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE COVID-SPECIFIC THEMES OF PRECAUTIONS TAKEN IN OUTPATIENT SERVICES AND OPERATING THEATERS, THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, THE ECONOMIC LOSS INCURRED, AND THE PERCEPTIBLE IMPACT OF TELEMEDICINE AND WEBINARS. THE LINKS TO THE SURVEY WERE MAILED TO NEUROSURGEONS IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PRACTICE COUNTRYWIDE. THE RESPONSES WERE ANONYMIZED TO ENSURE FREE AND UNBIASED ANSWERS TO THE SURVEY QUESTIONS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 176 RESPONSES WERE RECEIVED FROM ACROSS THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT. THE MEDIAN AGE OF RESPONDENTS WAS 39 YEARS (RANGE, 32-70 YEARS) AND THE POST-RESIDENCY EXPERIENCE WAS 7 YEARS (RANGE, 0-34 YEARS). RESPONDENTS WERE AN EQUITABLE MIX OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PRACTITIONERS. OF RESPONDENTS, 46\\% WERE PRACTICING RESTRICTED OUTPATIENT SERVICES, MORE IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS (P = 0.22) WHICH ALSO HAD A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF TELE-OUTPATIENT SERVICES (26\\% VS. 17\\%). WEARING SURGICAL MASKS, N95 MASKS, AND GLOVES WERE THE MOST COMMONLY PRACTICED PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES IN OUTPATIENT SERVICES (>60\\%). ALTHOUGH PRIVATE PRACTITIONERS WERE CONTINUING ELECTIVE CASES (40\\%), PUBLIC INSTITUTES WERE MORE CAUTIOUS, WITH ONLY EMERGENCY PATIENTS BEING OPERATED ON (29\\%). THE GREATEST FEAR AMONG ALL PRACTITIONERS WAS PASSING THE INFECTION TO THEIR FAMILY (75\\%). SOCIAL MEDIA WERE HELPFUL FOR BRAINSTORMING QUERIES AND UPDATING PRACTICE MODIFICATIONS, BUT SOME SURGEONS ADMITTED TO RECEIVING THREATS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (37.5\\%). DEPRESSION AND ECONOMIC LOSSES WERE PALPABLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 30\\% NEUROSURGEONS. CONCLUSIONS: THE SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS THE PERCEPTION OF NEUROSURGEONS TOWARD THE PANDEMIC AND THE DIFFERENCE IN PUBLICEPRIVATE PRACTICE. SUSPENSION OF ELECTIVE PROCEDURES, SEVERE CURTAILMENT OF REGULAR OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS, DRASTIC MODIFICATIONS OF THE NORMAL OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT/OPERATING ROOM PRACTICES, AND APPREHENSIONS RELATED TO INADEQUACY OF SAFETY PROVIDED BY PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT USE AND FINANCIAL LOSSES OF PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS WERE SOME OF THE VISIBLE THEMES IN OUR SURVEY RESULTS.

METHODS: HUMAN PROTEINS INTERACTING WITH SARS-COV-2 PROTEINS WERE IDENTIFIED BY GORDON ET AL. (2020). GENES THAT ARE UPREGULATED IN TROPHOBLAST SUB-TYPES AND STAGES WERE OBTAINED BY GENE-EXPRESSION DATA FROM NCBI-GEO AND BY TEXT-MINING.

GENES CRUCIAL IN PLACENTAL FUNCTIONS THUS IDENTIFIED WERE COMPARED TO THE SARS-COV-2 INTER-ACTOME FOR OVERLAPS. PROTEINS RECURRING ACROSS MULTIPLE STUDY SCENARIOS WERE ANALYZED USING TEXT MINING AND NETWORK ANALYSIS FOR THEIR BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. RESULTS: THE ENTRY RECEPTORS FOR SARS-COV-2 - ACE2 AND TMPRSS2 ARE EXPRESSED IN PLACENTA. OTHER PROTEINS THAT INTERACT WITH SARS-COV-2 LIKE LOX, FIBULINS-2 AND 5, NUP98, GDF15, RBX1, CUL3, HMOX1, PLAT, MFGE8, AND MRPS ARE VITAL IN PLACENTAL FUNCTIONS LIKE TMPHOBLAST INVASION AND MIGRATION, SYNCYTIUM FORMATION, DIFFERENTIATION, AND IMPLANTATION.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY HAS CREATED UNFORESEEN PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES INCLUDING A GLOBAL SHORTAGE OF PPE NEEDED FOR THE SAFETY OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS (HCWS). ALTHOUGH SUFFICIENT STOCKS OF PPE ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, THEIR CRITICAL SHORTAGE MAY DEVELOP SOON DUE TO INCREASE IN DEMAND AND DEPLETION OF EXISTING SUPPLY LINES. TO EMPOWER OUR HCWS AND ENSURE THEIR CONTINUED PROTECTION, PROACTIVE MEASURES ARE URGENTLY REQUIRED TO DEVELOP PROCEDURES TO SAFELY DECONTAMINATE THE PPES TO ALLOW THEIR ``SELECTIVE REUSE'' DURING CONTINGENCY SITUATIONS. METHODS HEREIN, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED A DECONTAMINATION METHOD BASED ON VAPORIZED HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (VHP). WE HAVE USED A RANGE OF CONCENTRATION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE TO DISINFECT PPE (COVERALLS, FACE-SHIELDS, AND N-95 MASKS). TO ENSURE A PROPER DISINFECTION, WE HAVE EVALUATED THREE BIOLOGICAL INDICATORS NAMELYESCHERICHIA COLI,MYCOBACTERIUM SMEGMATISAND SPORES OFBACILLUS STEAROTHERMOPHILUS, CONSIDERED AS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR DISINFECTION PROCESSES. WE NEXT EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF REPEATED VHP TREATMENT ON PHYSICAL FEATURES, PERMEABILITY, AND FABRIC INTEGRITY OF COVERALLS AND N-95 MASKS. NEXT, WE PERFORMED SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM) TO EVALUATE MICROSCOPIC CHANGES IN FIBER THICKNESS OF N-95 MASKS, MELT BLOWN LAYER OR COVERALL BODY SUITS. CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT ANY DISINFECTION PROCEDURE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MEET LOCAL REQUIREMENTS, OUR STUDY INCLUDED VARIOUS REGIONALLY PROCURED N-95 MASKS AND COVERALLS AVAILABLE AT OUR INSTITUTE AIIMS (AIIMS), NEW DELHI, INDIA. LASTLY, THE PRACTICAL UTILITY OF VHP METHOD DEVELOPED HEREIN WAS ASCERTAINED BY OPERATIONALIZING A DEDICATED RESEARCH FACILITY DISINFECTING USED PPE DURING COVID-19. RESULTS OUR PROTOTYPE STUDIES SHOW THAT A SINGLE VHP CYCLE (7-8\\% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE) COULD DISINFECT PPE AND PPE HOUSING ROOM OF ABOUT 1200 CUBIC FEET (LENGTH10 FT X BREADTH 10 FT X HEIGHT 12 FT) IN LESS THAN 10 MIN, AS NOTED BY A COMPLETE LOSS OFB. STEAROTHERMOPHILUSSPORE REVIVAL. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT AND REPRODUCIBLE AS TESTED IN OVER 10 CYCLES IN OUR SETTINGS. FURTHER, REPEATED VHP TREATMENT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY PHYSICAL TEAR, DEFORMITY OR OTHER APPRECIABLE CHANGE IN THE COVERALL AND N-95 MASKS. OUR PERMEATION TESTS EVALUATING DROPLET PENETRATION DID NOT REVEAL ANY CHANGE IN PERMEABILITY POST-VHP TREATMENTS. ALSO, SEM ANALYSIS INDEED REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN FIBER THICKNESS OR DAMAGE TO FIBERS OF COVERALLS OR MELT BLOWN LAYER OF N-95 MASKS ESSENTIAL FOR FILTRATION. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN USER COMFORT AND EXPERIENCE FOLLOWING VHP TREATMENT OF PPE. BASED ON RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES, AND PARAMETERS DEVELOPED AND OPTIMIZED, AN INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH FACILITY TO DISINFECT COVID-19 PPE IS SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHED AND OPERATIONALIZED WITH MORE THAN 80\\% RECOVERY RATE FOR USED PPE POST-DISINFECTION. CONCLUSIONS OUR STUDY, THEREFORE, SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHES THE UTILITY OF VHP TO EFFECTIVELY DISINFECT PPE FOR A POSSIBLE REUSE AS PER THE REQUIREMENTS. VHP TREATMENT DID NOT DAMAGE COVERALLS, CAUSE PHYSICAL DEFORMITY AND ALSO DID NOT ALTER FABRIC ARCHITECTURE OF MELT BLOWN LAYER. WE OBSERVED THAT DISINFECTION PROCESS WAS SUCCESSFUL CONSISTENTLY AND THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT THE VHP-BASED DECONTAMINATION MODEL WILL HAVE A UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY AND UTILITY. THIS PROCESS CAN BE EASILY AND ECONOMICALLY SCALED UP AND CAN BE INSTRUMENTAL IN EASING GLOBAL PPE SHORTAGES IN ANY BIOSAFETY FACILITY OR IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS DURING PANDEMIC SITUATION SUCH AS COVID-19.","PY":"2020","AU":"SAINI V;SIKRI K;BATRA S;KALRA P;GAUTAM K","TI":"DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE LOWCOST VAPORIZED HYDROGEN PEROXIDEBASED METHOD FOR DISINFECTION OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR THEIR SELECTIVE REUSE DURING PANDEMICS","Topic 1":0.000989736682651274,"Topic 2":0.000403530226925303,"Topic 3":0.00354021463574623,"Topic 4":0.0269721670175643,"Topic 5":0.066473260198811,"Topic 6":0.00337807746813358,"Topic 7":0.0018529651918995,"Topic 8":0.00285816596721176,"Topic 9":0.00525599999274478,"Topic 10":0.888275882618312},{"id":115,"body":"JUSTIFICATION DURING THE CURRENT RAPIDLY EVOLVING PANDEMIC OF COVID-19 INFECTION, PREGNANT WOMEN WITH SUSPECTED OR CONFIRMED COVID-19 AND THEIR NEWBORN INFANTS FORM A SPECIAL VULNERABLE GROUP THAT NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: BETWEEN MAY 7TH AND 23RD, 2020, A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CIRCULATED AMONGST PRACTISING NEUROSURGEONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BY SOCIAL MEDIA AND E-MAILS, REGARDING CHANGES IN THE PATTERNS OF PATIENTS SEEN, ADAPTATIONS MADE IN THEIR PRACTICE, EFFECT ON SURGERIES PERFORMED, FINANCIAL BURDEN, AND IMPACT ON THEIR PERSONAL LIVES. THE RESPONSES WERE KEPT ANONYMOUS AND WERE ANALYZED FOR CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE CHANGES OBSERVED AND INDEPENDENT FACTORS SUCH AS HOSPITAL AFFILIATIONS, TEACHING PROFESSIONS, AND NEUROSURGICAL EXPERIENCE. RESULTS: OUR SURVEY SHOWED A DRASTIC FALL IN THE NUMBER OF NEUROSURGICAL PATIENTS SEEN IN THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT (OPD) AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF SURGERIES PERFORMED. A DROP OF 76.25% WAS SEEN IN OPD PATIENTS (P = 0.000) AND THAT OF 70.59% IN SURGERIES PERFORMED (P = 0.000).

WE AIM TO PROVIDE A CONSENSUS GUIDELINE BASED ON THE CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH (ICMR) AND THE POOLED EXPERIENCE OF THE MAJOR CENTERS PERFORMING PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY IN INDIA. METHODS: THE CURRENT GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WERE STUDIED FROM BOTH GOVERNMENT AND NONGOVERNMENT SOURCES INCLUDING ICMR. THE PROBLEMS IN THE SPECIALTY OF PLASTIC SURGERY WERE CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR GROUPS AND FOR EACH GROUP, SEPARATE AND INDIVIDUAL GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN FORMULATED. GUIDELINES: CONSENSUS GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN FORMULATED FOR THE SPECIALTY OF PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY. THE PATIENTS REQUIRING PLASTIC SURGERY SERVICE HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR GROUPS OF ACUTE, SUBACUTE, CHRONIC, AND LATE CATEGORY. ACUTE CASES ARE THE ONES WHO REQUIRE INTERVENTION WITHIN 2448 H. SUBACUTE CASES ARE THE ONES WHO REQUIRE INTERVENTION IN THE NEXT 310 DAYS, WHILE THE CHRONIC ARE THE ONES WHO NEED PLASTIC SURGERY PREFERABLY WITHIN A MONTH. THE LATE CATEGORY ARE THE ONES WHO NEED SURGERY WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. THIS HAS BEEN DONE BASED ON THE URGENCY AND PRIORITY OF SURGICAL INTERVENTION TITRATED AGAINST THE RISKS OF OPERATING AND INADVERTENTLY ACQUIRING THE EXPOSURE OF COVID-19-POSITIVE PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: CURRENTLY, IN THE WAKE OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THERE ARE NO CLEAR GUIDELINES SPECIFIC TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WHO COME FOR A PLASTIC SURGERY INTERVENTION. THIS PUTS THE PATIENTS AT RISK DUE TO THE IMPENDING PLASTIC SURGERY PROBLEM WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IT POSES A RISK OF EXPOSURE TO COVID-19 FOR THE SURGICAL TEAM. CONSENSUS GUIDELINES ARE PRESENTED, TO STEER THE PLASTIC SURGEON IN HIS WORK, IN THE WAKE OF COVID-19 CRISIS. THE GUIDELINES ARE BASED ON FIRM SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FROM THE REPUTED RESEARCH AND REGULATORY BODIES AND HAVE BEEN MADE IN CONSONANCE WITH PLASTIC SURGERY EXPERTS AROUND THE COUNTRY, SO THAT THESE PRACTICES BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF THE PATIENTS, WHILE BEING MINDFUL OF RESOURCE LIMITATIONS AND INFECTION RISKS.

HOSPITAL STAY DURATION WAS CONSIDERED AS PRIMARY, WHILE THE CATEGORY OF DISEASE ON ADMISSION, CLINICAL COURSE, THE REQUIREMENT OF OXYGEN, AND MORTALITY AND RESIDUAL SYMPTOMS WERE TAKEN AS A SECONDARY OUTCOME TO COMPARE THE GROUPS. RESULTS: OVERALL GROUP-1 HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OF MILD DISEASE, WHILE GROUP-2 HAD MODERATE CASES (39 [76.5%] VS. 14 [14.6%] P < 0.01). MENOPAUSAL GROUP HAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REQUIREMENT OF OXYGEN (32 [62.7%] VS. 20 [20.8%]), VENTILATION (14 [27.5%] VS. 1 [1%]) PROGRESSION-TO-SEVERE DISEASE (23.5% VS. 7.3%) AND PROLONGED HOSPITAL STAY ([14.1 8.9 VS. 8.6 3.9 DAYS] P < 0.01). HOWEVER, MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION FAILED TO SHOW A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HOSPITAL STAY AND PROGRESSION WITH MENOPAUSE. FERRITIN AND RESIDUAL SYMPTOMS FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN MENOPAUSAL. CONCLUSIONS: NO DEFINITE ASSOCIATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN MENOPAUSE AND COVID-19 OUTCOME WITH HOSPITAL STAY DURATION OR DISEASE PROGRESSION IN OUR STUDY. 2020 WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS.

THE LOCKDOWN AFFECTED TRANSPORTATION, ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FACILITIES, AND AVAILABILITY OF MEDICINES AND CONSUMABLES AS WELL AS OUTPATIENT AND INPATIENT SERVICES. WE AIMED TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF LOCKDOWN IMPOSED DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY DISEASES IN INDIA. METHODS: WE SURVEYED 19 MAJOR HOSPITALS (8 IN THE PUBLIC AND 11 IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR) TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF LOCKDOWN ON THE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY DISEASE, INCLUDING THOSE ON DIALYSIS AFTER THE FIRST 3 WEEKS OF LOCKDOWN. RESULTS: THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DIALYSIS PATIENTS IN THESE CENTERS CAME DOWN FROM 2517 TO 2404. APPROXIMATELY 710 (28.2\\%) PATIENTS MISSED 1 OR MORE DIALYSIS SESSIONS, 69 (2.74\\%) REQUIRED EMERGENCY DIALYSIS SESSIONS, 104 (4.13\\%) STOPPED REPORTING FOR DIALYSIS, AND 9 (0.36\\%) WERE CONFIRMED TO HAVE DIED.

WE AIMED TO EXAMINE AND INTERPRET THE CHANGES IN ONLINE SEARCH INTEREST FOR KEYWORDS REPRESENTING DIFFERENT ALCOHOL-RELATED THEMES DURING THE LOCKDOWN PERIOD IN INDIA. DESIGN AND METHODS: DATA WERE EXTRACTED USING THE FRAMEWORK DESCRIBED FOR USING GOOGLE TRENDS IN HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH. THE LIST OF ALCOHOL-RELATED SEARCH QUERIES WAS PREPARED FOR FOUR BROAD THEMES: TYPES OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES CONSUMED; MEANS OF ACCESSING ALCOHOL; PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED DUE TO BREAK IN ALCOHOL SUPPLY; AND HELP-SEEKING FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS. THE MEAN RELATIVE SEARCH VOLUMES ACROSS THREE TIME PERIODS (PRE-LOCKDOWN; LOCKDOWN 1.0; LOCKDOWN 2.0) WERE COMPARED USING SPSS VERSION 23.0. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ONLINE SEARCH INTEREST FOR KEYWORDS RELATED TO THE PROCUREMENT OF ALCOHOL WAS OBSERVED IN LOCKDOWN 1.0 BUT NOT DURING LOCKDOWN 2.0, COMPARED WITH PRE-LOCKDOWN.

THE MAIN PROTEASE (MPRO) OF THIS VIRUS PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN CLEAVING THE TRANSLATED POLYPEPTIDES THAT MAKES IT A POTENTIAL DRUG TARGET AGAINST COVID-19. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF MPRO, WE SCREENED APPROVED DRUGS FROM THE DRUG BANK TO FIND A POSSIBLE INHIBITOR AGAINST MPRO USING COMPUTATIONAL METHODS AND FURTHER VALIDATING THEM WITH BIOCHEMICAL STUDIES. THE DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS STUDY REVEALED THAT DB04983 (DENUFOSOL) SHOWED THE BEST GLIDE DOCKING SCORE, -11.884 KCAL/MOL, AND MM-PBSA BINDING FREE ENERGY, -10.96 KCAL/MOL. COBICISTAT, CANGRELOR (PREVIOUS COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES IN OUR LAB), AND DENUFOSOL (CURRENT STUDY) WERE TESTED FOR THE IN VITRO INHIBITORY EFFECTS ON MPRO. THE IC50 VALUES OF THESE DRUGS WERE SIMILAR TO 6.7 MU M, 0.9 MM, AND 1.3 MM, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE VALUES OF DISSOCIATION CONSTANTS CALCULATED USING SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE WERE SIMILAR TO 2.1 0.7 MU M, AND 1.4 MM, RESPECTIVELY. WE FOUND THAT COBICISTAT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT INHIBITOR OF MPRO BOTH IN SILICO AND IN VITRO.

MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO ANALYZE THE CHANGES INTHE NUMBER OF HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR AMI IN HOSPITALS ACROSS INDIA. IN ADDITION, WE INTEND TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE WEEKLY AMI ADMISSION RATES, AND OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURES LIKE RATES OF THROMBOLYSIS/PRIMARY PERCUTANEOUS INTERVENTIONS (PCI), WINDOW PERIOD, DOOR TO BALLOON TIME, AND DOOR TO NEEDLE TIME. OTHER OBJECTIVES INCLUDE EVALUATION OF CHANGES IN THE MAJOR COMPLICATIONS AND MORTALITY RATES OF AMI AND ITS PREDICTORS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. CONCLUSIONS: THIS CSI-AMI STUDY WILL PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON AMI CARE IN INDIA. BASED ON THIS STUDY, WE MAY BE ABLE TO SUGGEST APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO THE EXISTING MI GUIDELINES AND TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC REGARDING EMERGENCY CARE FOR AMI DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. 2020 CARDIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA","PY":"2020","AU":"RAMAKRISHNAN S;JABIR A;JAYAGOPAL P;MOHANAN P;NAIR V;DAS M;MANDAL M;ROY D;REDDY S;MALVIYA A;SINGH B;BHARTI B;MAJUMDER B;KARUNADAS C;MEENA C;GIRISH M;EZHILAN J;TUMMALA K;KATYAL V;SUBRAMANYAM K;GOYAL K;KENCHAPPA K;GUPTA M;HANUMANTHAPPA N;BARDOLOI N;MODI N;BHATTACHARYYA P;GADKARI P;PATIL R;MURTY R;BARUAH R;KRISHNAPPA S;KUMAR S;ROUTRAY S;TEWARI S;GUPTA S;MADURAMUTHU S;YERRAM S;KUMAR S;JADHAV U;MANJUNATH C;PRABHAKARAN D;KERKER P;YADAV R;GUHA S;DEB P;ZACHARIAH G","TI":"PATTERN OF ACUTE MI ADMISSIONS IN INDIA DURING COVID19 ERA A CARDIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA STUDY RATIONALE AND DESIGN","Topic 1":0.0119997492684943,"Topic 2":0.00403955146663333,"Topic 3":0.301381117816234,"Topic 4":0.0221880058418944,"Topic 5":0.041426247336815,"Topic 6":0.0138831659898239,"Topic 7":0.00754528032613366,"Topic 8":0.25674641637105,"Topic 9":0.0252570035850462,"Topic 10":0.315533461997876},{"id":228,"body":"PULMONARY ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS (PAP) IS AN UNCOMMON LUNG DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY EXCESSIVE ACCUMULATION OF PULMONARY SURFACTANT THAT USUALLY REQUIRES TREATMENT WITH WHOLE-LUNG LAVAGE.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS IS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES. MAJOR DATABASE SEARCHES WERE CARRIED OUT UP UNTIL JUNE 5, 2020. PARTICIPANTS ADMITTED WITH RT-PCR-CONFIRMED SARS COV-2 (COVID-19) INFECTION WERE INCLUDED. THE ``INTERVENTION GROUP'' RECEIVED ANTI-MALARIAL DRUGS WITH OR WITHOUT OTHER DRUGS (AZITHROMYCIN) ADMINISTERED AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE STANDARD TREATMENT/CARE. THE ``CONTROL GROUP'' RECEIVED TREATMENT EXCEPT ANTI-MALARIAL DRUGS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS ``ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY.'' SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE EFFECTS ON CLINICAL AND LABORATORY PARAMETERS AND ADVERSE EVENTS. RESULTS: OF 3,472 CITATIONS, 17 (SIX CLINICAL TRIALS AND 11 OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES) STUDIES PROVIDED DATA OF 8,071 PARTICIPANTS. COMPARED TO THE CONTROL, HYDROXY-CHLOROQUINE (HCQ) HAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON MORTALITY [(OR 0.87; 95\\% CI 0.46-1.64); EIGHT OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES; N = 5,944].

COMPARED TO THE CONTROL, RISK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN HCQ GROUP [(OR 3.35; 95\\% CI 1.58-7.13); FOUR CLINICAL TRIALS; N = 263]. COMPARED TO CONTROL, RISK OF ADVERSE CARDIAC EVENTS (ABNORMAL ECG, ARRHYTHMIA, OR QT PROLONGATION) WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN HCQ GROUP (BUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN THE HCQ PLUS AZM GROUP). THE GRADE EVIDENCE GENERATED FOR ALL THE OUTCOMES WAS OF ``VERY LOW-QUALITY.'' CONCLUSIONS: AS VERY LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS AN INCREASED RISK OF MORTALITY AND ADVERSE EVENT WITH HCQ PLUS AZITHROMYCIN COMBINATION (NOT HCQ ALONE), CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHILE PRESCRIBING THIS COMBINATION FOR TREATMENT OF HOSPITALIZED ADULTS WITH COVID-19 INFECTION.

WE RECORDED THE PATIENT'S REASON FOR CALL, MAIN BARRIERS TO A HOSPITAL VISIT, AND THE ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO THEM BY THE PHYSICIAN ON CALL. EACH CALLER WAS ASKED TO MEASURE HIS/HER SATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICE ON A 4-POINT SCALE. RESULTS: OUT OF 314 PATIENTS, 143 (45.54%) BELONGED TO DELHI AND 171 (54.46%) BELONGED TO OTHER STATES. 157 PATIENTS SOUGHT HELP FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT; 86 PATIENTS NEEDED TO RESTOCK THEIR OPIOID MEDICATIONS. SEVENTY-ONE PATIENTS REQUIRED INFORMATION REGARDING THEIR ONCOLOGICAL TREATMENTS REQUIRING CONSULTATION FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS. TITRATION OF ORAL OPIOIDS AND MEDICATION PRESCRIPTION (N = 129), CONTACT DETAILS OF OTHER PC UNITS AT THEIR NATIVE STATE FOR OPIOID PROCUREMENT (N = 55), AND ATTACHMENT TO OUR COMMUNITY-BASED PC SERVICE (N = 22) WERE MAIN MODES OF MANAGEMENT. FIFTY-SIX PATIENTS WERE VERY SATISFIED AND 152 PATIENTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE. CONCLUSION: TELEMEDICINE IS THE FUTURE OF HEALTH-CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. IN PC, WE DEAL WITH IMMUNOCOMPROMISED DEBILITATED CANCER PATIENTS AND TELEMEDICINE IS IMMENSELY HELPFUL FOR US TO PROVIDE HOLISTIC INTEGRATED CARE TO THESE PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO VISIT HOSPITALS REGULARLY. 2020 WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS.

RESULT TWO PATIENTS FROM \"RED ZONES\" FOR COVID-19 PANDEMIC PRESENTED WITH ACUTE ABDOMEN, ONE A 64-YEAR MALE, WHO PRESENTED WITH PERFORATION PERITONITIS AND ANOTHER, A 57-YEAR MALE WITH ACUTE INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION DUE TO SIGMOID VOLVULUS. THEY ALSO HAD ASSOCIATED COVID-19 SYMPTOMS. COVID-19 TEST COULD NOT BE DONE AT THE TIME OF THEIR PRESENTATION TO THE HOSPITAL. PATIENTS UNDERWENT EMERGENCY EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY ASSUMING THEM TO BE POSITIVE FOR THE INFECTION. SURGICAL TEAM WAS DONNED WITH FULL COVERALL PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. SUDDEN AND UNCONTROLLED EGRESSION INTRAPERITONEAL FREE GAS WAS AVOIDED, ECHELON FLEX 60 STAPLERS WERE USED TO RESECT THE VOLVULUS WITHOUT ALLOWING THE GAS FROM THE VOLVULUS TO ESCAPE; MESOCOLON WAS DIVIDED USING VASCULAR RELOAD OF THE STAPLER, NO ELECTROSURGICAL DEVICES WERE USED TO AVOID THE AEROSOLIZATION OF VIRAL PARTICLES.

THE OUTBREAK WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COV), NAMED AS SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS)-COV-2 AND THE DISEASE AS COVID-19. WITHIN ONE MONTH, CASES WERE REPORTED FROM 25 COUNTRIES. IN VIEW OF THE NOVEL VIRAL STRAIN WITH REPORTED HIGH MORBIDITY, ESTABLISHING EARLY COUNTRYWIDE DIAGNOSIS TO DETECT IMPORTED CASES BECAME CRITICAL. HERE WE DESCRIBE THE ROLE OF A COUNTRYWIDE NETWORK OF VRDLS IN EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF COVID-19. METHODS: THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH (ICMR)-NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGY (NIV), PUNE, ESTABLISHED SCREENING AS WELL AS CONFIRMATORY ASSAYS FOR SARS-COV-2. A TOTAL OF 13 VRDLS WERE PROVIDED WITH THE E GENE SCREENING REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION-POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RRT-PCR) ASSAY. VRDLS WERE SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR PRESENCE NEAR AN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT/SEAPORT AND THEIR PAST PERFORMANCE. THE CASE DEFINITION FOR TESTING INCLUDED ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH TRAVEL HISTORY TO WUHAN AND SYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS WITH TRAVEL HISTORY TO OTHER PARTS OF CHINA. THIS WAS LATER EXPANDED TO INCLUDE SYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS RETURNING FROM SINGAPORE, JAPAN, HONG KONG, THAILAND AND SOUTH KOREA. RESULTS: WITHIN A WEEK OF STANDARDIZATION OF THE TEST AT NIV, ALL VRDLS COULD INITIATE TESTING FOR SARS-COV-2. TILL FEBRUARY 29, 2020, A TOTAL OF 2,913 SAMPLES WERE TESTED. THIS INCLUDED BOTH 654 INDIVIDUALS QUARANTINED IN THE TWO CAMPS AND OTHERS FITTING WITHIN THE CASE DEFINITION. THE QUARANTINED INDIVIDUALS WERE TESTED TWICE - AT DAYS 0 AND 14.

WE AIM TO CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE TO HIGHLIGHT THE EFFECT OF AWAKE PRONING ON THE NEED FOR INTUBATION, IMPROVEMENT IN OXYGENATION AND MORTALITY RATES IN COVID-19 PATIENTS WITH ARDS. METHOD: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF 2 MEDICAL DATABASES (PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR) WAS PERFORMED UNTIL JULY 5, 2020. THIRTEEN STUDIES FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, AND 210 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED FOR THE FINAL ANALYSIS. RESULT: MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS WERE ABOVE 50 YEARS OF AGE WITH A MALE GENDER PREDOMINANCE (69%). FACE MASK (26%) WAS THE MOST COMMON INTERFACE USED FOR OXYGEN THERAPY. THE INTUBATION AND MORTALITY RATES WERE 23.80% (50/210) AND 5.41% (5/203) RESPECTIVELY.

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THESE PUBLICATIONS TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE BURDEN OF THESE PSYCHIATRIC/BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS IS NEEDED FOR PLANNING MITIGATING MEASURES BY THE HEALTH AUTHORITIES. METHODS: DIFFERENT ELECTRONIC DATABASES (MEDLINE, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, CENTRAL, MEDRXIV AND BIORXIV) WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES DESCRIBING PSYCHOLOGICAL/BEHAVIORAL COMPLICATIONS IN CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS WITH/WITHOUT PRE-EXISTING BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES AND THEIR CAREGIVERS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. ONLY ORIGINAL ARTICLES WITH/WITHOUT COMPARATOR ARMS AND A MINIMUM SAMPLE SIZE OF 50 WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE POOLED ESTIMATE OF VARIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL/BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS WAS CALCULATED USING A RANDOM-EFFECT META-ANALYSIS. RESULTS: FIFTEEN STUDIES DESCRIBING 22996 CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS FULFILLED THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FROM A TOTAL OF 219 RECORDS. OVERALL, 34.5%, 41.7%, 42.3% AND 30.8% OF CHILDREN WERE FOUND TO BE SUFFERING FROM ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, IRRITABILITY AND INATTENTION. ALTHOUGH THE BEHAVIOR/PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE OF A TOTAL OF 79.4% OF CHILDREN WAS AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY THE PANDEMIC AND QUARANTINE, AT LEAST 22.5% OF CHILDREN HAD A SIGNIFICANT FEAR OF COVID-19, AND 35.2% AND 21.3% OF CHILDREN HAD BOREDOM AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE. SIMILARLY, 52.3% AND 27.4% OF CAREGIVERS DEVELOPED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE BEING IN ISOLATION WITH CHILDREN. CONCLUSION: ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, IRRITABILITY, BOREDOM, INATTENTION AND FEAR OF COVID-19 ARE PREDOMINANT NEW-ONSET PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN CHILDREN DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

THE STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP AN EARLY WARNING SCREENING TOOL TO RAPIDLY DETECT 'HIGHLY SUSPECT' AMONG THE PATIENTS SCHEDULED FOR SURGERY. METHODS: REVIEW OF LITERATURE WAS CONDUCTED USING TERMS 'CORONAVIRUS' OR 'NCOV 2019' OR 'SARS-COV-2' OR 'COVID-19' AND 'CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS' IN PUBMED AND MEDRXIV. SUITABLE ARTICLES WERE ANALYSED FOR SYMPTOMS AND INVESTIGATIONS COMMONLY FOUND IN COVID-19 PATIENTS. ADDITIONALLY, COVID-19 PATIENT'S SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND INVESTIGATION PROFILES WERE OBTAINED THROUGH A SURVEY FROM 20 COVID-19 FACILITIES IN INDIA. BASED ON LITERATURE EVIDENCE AND THE SURVEY INFORMATION, AN EARLY WARNING SCORING SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED. RESULTS: LITERATURE SEARCH YIELDED 3737 PUBLICATIONS, OF WHICH 195 WERE CONSIDERED RELEVANT. OF THESE 195 STUDIES, THOSE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSES WERE NOT CONSIDERED FOR INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT.

THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE TRENDS IN OPIOID DISPENSING FOR CANCER PAIN BEFORE AND DURING THE LOCKDOWN. METHODS: THE TRENDS WERE CALCULATED BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF QUANTITY OF ALL OPIOIDS DISPENSED. MARCH 24, 2020, WAS CONSIDERED AS A CUTOFF FOR ANALYZING BEFORE AND DURING LOCKDOWN PERIOD DISPENSING TRENDS. NO INFORMATION REGARDING INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS WAS RETRIEVED IN THE CURRENT STUDY. RESULTS: THERE WAS A DECREASE IN TOTAL MORPHINE, TRAMADOL, AND FENTANYL PATCH DISPENSING PARALLEL TO DECREASE IN TOTAL NUMBER OF PATIENTS VISITING THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS AGREEMENT BETWEEN GARGLE LAVAGE AND SWAB AS AN APPROPRIATE RESPIRATORY SAMPLE FOR THE DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2. THE SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS THE PATIENT ACCEPTABILITY OF THE TWO SAMPLING METHODS. METHODS: IT WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY DONE AT A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL IN NEW DELHI, INDIA, ON 50 CONFIRMED COVID-19 PATIENTS. PAIRED SWAB (NPS AND OPS) AND GARGLE SAMPLES WERE TAKEN WITHIN 72 H OF THEIR DIAGNOSIS. SAMPLES WERE PROCESSED BY REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION-POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) FOR DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2. POST-SAMPLE COLLECTION, A 10-POINT SCALE WAS ADMINISTERED TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF DISCOMFORT WITH EITHER OF THE COLLECTION METHODS. RESULTS: ALL GARGLE SAMPLES WERE POSITIVE AND COMPARABLE TO THEIR CORRESPONDING SWAB SAMPLES IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SYMPTOMS AND DURATION OF ILLNESS. THE CYCLE THRESHOLD (C-T) VALUES FOR GARGLE SAMPLES WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER BUT COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF SWABS. BLAND-ALTMAN PLOT SHOWED GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO METHODS.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: ANALYSIS OF WHOLE BLOOD DONORS TESTED FOR SARS-COV-2 IGG ANTIBODIES WAS CARRIED OUT AFTER CATEGORIZING THEM INTO HEALTHCARE WORKERS (HCW) AND NON-HEALTHCARE WORKERS (NHCW). NHCW WERE FURTHER CATEGORIZED INTO RESIDENTS OF CONTAINMENT AND NON-CONTAINMENT ZONES AND SEROPREVALENCE ANALYZED. SEROPREVALENCE AMONG DIFFERENT ABO BLOOD GROUPS WAS ALSO ANALYZED. RESULTS: 1191 BLOOD DONORS WERE TESTED FOR SARS-COV-2 ANTIBODIES WITH 9.5 % SEROPOSITIVITY. SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SEROPOSITIVITY OF 3.2 % (P < 0.001) WAS OBSERVED AMONG HCW AS COMPARED TO 10.9 % SEROPOSITIVITY IN NHCW.

OUR PRIMARY AIM WAS TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS THE CONCERNS OF HCPS WORKING IN COVID AREA IN A TERTIARY INSTITUTIONAL ISOLATION CENTER. METHODOLOGY: AN ONLINE GOOGLE-BASED QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AFTER APPROVAL OF THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD TO A TOTAL OF 100 HCPS WHO WERE TREATING AND MANAGING COVID-POSITIVE PATIENTS. RESULTS: OF 100 RESPONSES, 72% WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISK OF INFECTION TO SELF AND FAMILY, WHILE 46% REPORTED DISRUPTION OF THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES AT A PERSONAL LEVEL. AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL, 17% WERE CONCERNED ABOUT INADEQUATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT-RELATED CHALLENGES. 20% HAD INADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING ABOUT COVID. 16% OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ANXIOUS ALL THE TIME, 11% FEARED ALL THE TIME, AND 12% HAD STRESS ALL THE TIME WHILE TREATING COVID PATIENTS. CONNECTEDNESS AND COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS, WORD OF APPRECIATION, MUSIC, AND TV WERE FEW STRATEGIES TO COPE UP WITH THESE CHALLENGES.

COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER PREVALENCE OF EXPOSED OBESE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF MORTALITIES. THE ANALYSIS ALSO PROVED THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVING MORE ADIPOSE TISSUE IN BODY HAVE AHIGHER LEVEL OF ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME2 (ACE2), WHICH IS IDENTIFIED AS FUNCTIONAL RECEPTOR FOR COVID-19. THEREFORE, OBESE INDIVIDUALS ARE WORSE IN CONDITION BECAUSE OF AHIGHER PRESENCE OF ADIPOSITY INCREASES THE NUMBER OF ACE2 EXPRESSING CELLS. FURTHERMORE, IN SILICO INTERACTIONS OF ACE2 AND DIFFERENT VARIANTS OF CORONAVIRUS 2 (COV-2) SPIKE S1 PROTEIN SUGGEST THAT MUTANT STRAINS ARE MORE INFECTIOUS THAN WILDTYPE AS THEY BIND TO HOST ACE2 PROTEIN WITH HIGH BINDING AFFINITIES.

WE REPORT THE FINDINGS OF THE FIRST ROUND OF A NATIONAL SEROSURVEY, CONDUCTED TO ESTIMATE THE SEROPREVALENCE OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AMONG ADULT POPULATION OF INDIA. METHODS: FROM MAY 11 TO JUNE 4, 2020, A RANDOMLY SAMPLED, COMMUNITY-BASED SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN 700 VILLAGES/WARDS, SELECTED FROM THE 70 DISTRICTS OF THE 21 STATES OF INDIA, CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR STRATA BASED ON THE INCIDENCE OF REPORTED COVID-19 CASES. FOUR HUNDRED ADULTS PER DISTRICT WERE ENROLLED FROM 10 CLUSTERS WITH ONE ADULT PER HOUSEHOLD. SERUM SAMPLES WERE TESTED FOR IGG ANTIBODIES USING COVID KAVACH ELISA KIT. ALL POSITIVE SERUM SAMPLES WERE RE-TESTED USING EUROIMMUN SARS-COV-2 ELISA. ADJUSTING FOR SURVEY DESIGN AND SERIAL TEST PERFORMANCE, WEIGHTED SEROPREVALENCE, NUMBER OF INFECTIONS, INFECTION TO CASE RATIO (ICR) AND INFECTION FATALITY RATIO (IFR) WERE CALCULATED. LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH IGG POSITIVITY. RESULTS: TOTAL OF 30,283 HOUSEHOLDS WERE VISITED AND 28,000 INDIVIDUALS WERE ENROLLED. POPULATION-WEIGHTED SEROPREVALENCE AFTER ADJUSTING FOR TEST PERFORMANCE WAS 0.73 PER CENT [95\\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI): 0.34-1.13]. MALES, LIVING IN URBAN SLUMS AND OCCUPATION WITH HIGH RISK OF EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY INFECTED PERSONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SEROPOSITIVITY. A CUMULATIVE 6,468,388 ADULT INFECTIONS (95\\% CI: 3,829,029-11,199,423) WERE ESTIMATED IN INDIA BY THE EARLY MAY. THE OVERALL ICR WAS BETWEEN 81.6 (95\\% CI: 48.3-141.4) AND 130.1 (95\\% CI: 77.0-225.2) WITH MAY 11 AND MAY 3, 2020 AS PLAUSIBLE REFERENCE POINTS FOR REPORTED CASES. THE IFR IN THE SURVEYED DISTRICTS FROM HIGH STRATUM, WHERE DEATH REPORTING WAS MORE ROBUST, WAS 11.72 (95\\% CI: 7.21-19.19) TO 15.04 (9.26-24.62) PER 10,000 ADULTS, USING MAY 24 AND JUNE 1, 2020 AS PLAUSIBLE REFERENCE POINTS FOR REPORTED DEATHS. INTERPRETATION \\& CONCLUSIONS: SEROPREVALENCE OF SARS-COV-2 WAS LOW AMONG THE ADULT POPULATION IN INDIA AROUND THE BEGINNING OF MAY 2020.
