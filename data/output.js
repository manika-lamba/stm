THE STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF DELAYED PLANNING OR LACK OF PLANNING FOR THE LOCKDOWN AND INADEQUATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCKDOWN, ON THE TRANSMISSION RATE OF COVID-19. METHOD: EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA ON THE INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY OF COVID-19 CASES AS REPORTED BY PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES WERE ACCESSED FROM SIX COUNTRIES BASED ON TOTAL NUMBER OF INFECTED CASES, NAMELY, UNITED STATES AND ITALY (MORE THAN 100 000 CASES); UNITED KINGDOM, AND FRANCE (50 000-100 000 CASES), AND INDIA AND RUSSIA (6000-10 000 CASES). THE BAYESIAN INFERENTIAL TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO OBSERVE THE CHANGES (THREE POINTS) IN PATTERN OF NUMBER OF CASES ON DIFFERENT DURATION OF EXPOSURE (IN DAYS) IN THESE SELECTED COUNTRIES 1 MONTH AFTER WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) DECLARATION ABOUT COVID-19 AS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS AGREEMENT BETWEEN GARGLE LAVAGE AND SWAB AS AN APPROPRIATE RESPIRATORY SAMPLE FOR THE DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2. THE SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS THE PATIENT ACCEPTABILITY OF THE TWO SAMPLING METHODS. METHODS: IT WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY DONE AT A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL IN NEW DELHI, INDIA, ON 50 CONFIRMED COVID-19 PATIENTS. PAIRED SWAB (NPS AND OPS) AND GARGLE SAMPLES WERE TAKEN WITHIN 72 H OF THEIR DIAGNOSIS. SAMPLES WERE PROCESSED BY REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION-POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) FOR DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2.

RESULTS: ALL GARGLE SAMPLES WERE POSITIVE AND COMPARABLE TO THEIR CORRESPONDING SWAB SAMPLES IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SYMPTOMS AND DURATION OF ILLNESS.

METHODS: HUMAN PROTEINS INTERACTING WITH SARS-COV-2 PROTEINS WERE IDENTIFIED BY GORDON ET AL. (2020). GENES THAT ARE UPREGULATED IN TROPHOBLAST SUB-TYPES AND STAGES WERE OBTAINED BY GENE-EXPRESSION DATA FROM NCBI-GEO AND BY TEXT-MINING. GENES ALTERED IN PATHOLOGICAL STATES LIKE PRE-ECLAMPSIA AND GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED. GENES CRUCIAL IN PLACENTAL FUNCTIONS THUS IDENTIFIED WERE COMPARED TO THE SARS-COV-2 INTER-ACTOME FOR OVERLAPS. PROTEINS RECURRING ACROSS MULTIPLE STUDY SCENARIOS WERE ANALYZED USING TEXT MINING AND NETWORK ANALYSIS FOR THEIR BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. RESULTS: THE ENTRY RECEPTORS FOR SARS-COV-2 - ACE2 AND TMPRSS2 ARE EXPRESSED IN PLACENTA. OTHER PROTEINS THAT INTERACT WITH SARS-COV-2 LIKE LOX, FIBULINS-2 AND 5, NUP98, GDF15, RBX1, CUL3, HMOX1, PLAT, MFGE8, AND MRPS ARE VITAL IN PLACENTAL FUNCTIONS LIKE TMPHOBLAST INVASION AND MIGRATION, SYNCYTIUM FORMATION, DIFFERENTIATION, AND IMPLANTATION.

THE PROBLEMS IN THE SPECIALTY OF PLASTIC SURGERY WERE CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR GROUPS AND FOR EACH GROUP, SEPARATE AND INDIVIDUAL GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN FORMULATED. GUIDELINES: CONSENSUS GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN FORMULATED FOR THE SPECIALTY OF PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY. THE PATIENTS REQUIRING PLASTIC SURGERY SERVICE HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR GROUPS OF ACUTE, SUBACUTE, CHRONIC, AND LATE CATEGORY. ACUTE CASES ARE THE ONES WHO REQUIRE INTERVENTION WITHIN 2448 H. SUBACUTE CASES ARE THE ONES WHO REQUIRE INTERVENTION IN THE NEXT 310 DAYS, WHILE THE CHRONIC ARE THE ONES WHO NEED PLASTIC SURGERY PREFERABLY WITHIN A MONTH. THE LATE CATEGORY ARE THE ONES WHO NEED SURGERY WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.

BBV152 IS A WHOLE-VIRION INACTIVATED SARS-COV-2 VACCINE FORMULATED WITH A TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 7/8 AGONIST MOLECULE ADSORBED TO ALUM (ALGEL-IMDG) OR ALUM (ALGEL). METHODS: WE DID A DOUBLE-BLIND, MULTICENTRE, RANDOMISED, CONTROLLED PHASE 1 TRIAL TO ASSESS THE SAFETY AND IMMUNOGENICITY OF BBV152 AT 11 HOSPITALS ACROSS INDIA. HEALTHY ADULTS AGED 1855 YEARS WHO WERE DEEMED HEALTHY BY THE INVESTIGATOR WERE ELIGIBLE. INDIVIDUALS WITH POSITIVE SARS-COV-2 NUCLEIC ACID AND/OR SEROLOGY TESTS WERE EXCLUDED. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE EITHER ONE OF THREE VACCINE FORMULATIONS (3 G WITH ALGEL-IMDG, 6 G WITH ALGEL-IMDG, OR 6 G WITH ALGEL) OR AN ALGEL ONLY CONTROL VACCINE GROUP. BLOCK RANDOMISATION WAS DONE WITH A WEB RESPONSE PLATFORM. PARTICIPANTS AND INVESTIGATORS WERE MASKED TO TREATMENT GROUP ALLOCATION. TWO INTRAMUSCULAR DOSES OF VACCINES WERE ADMINISTERED ON DAY 0 (THE DAY OF RANDOMISATION) AND DAY 14. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE SOLICITED LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC REACTOGENICITY EVENTS AT 2 H AND 7 DAYS AFTER VACCINATION AND THROUGHOUT THE FULL STUDY DURATION, INCLUDING SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. SECONDARY OUTCOME WAS SEROCONVERSION (AT LEAST FOUR-FOLD INCREASE FROM BASELINE) BASED ON WILD-TYPE VIRUS NEUTRALISATION. CELL-MEDIATED RESPONSES WERE EVALUATED BY INTRACELLULAR STAINING AND ELISPOT. THE TRIAL IS REGISTERED AT CLINICALTRIALS.GOV (NCT04471519). FINDINGS: BETWEEN JULY 13 AND 30, 2020, 827 PARTICIPANTS WERE SCREENED, OF WHOM 375 WERE ENROLLED. AMONG THE ENROLLED PARTICIPANTS, 100 EACH WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THE THREE VACCINE GROUPS, AND 75 WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (ALGEL ONLY). AFTER BOTH DOSES, SOLICITED LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC ADVERSE REACTIONS WERE REPORTED BY 17 (17%; 95% CI 105261) PARTICIPANTS IN THE 3 G WITH ALGEL-IMDG GROUP, 21 (21%; 138305) IN THE 6 G WITH ALGEL-IMDG GROUP, 14 (14%; 81227) IN THE 6 G WITH ALGEL GROUP, AND TEN (10%; 69236) IN THE ALGEL-ONLY GROUP. THE MOST COMMON SOLICITED ADVERSE EVENTS WERE INJECTION SITE PAIN (17 [5%] OF 375 PARTICIPANTS), HEADACHE (13 [3%]), FATIGUE (11 [3%]), FEVER (NINE [2%]), AND NAUSEA OR VOMITING (SEVEN [2%]). ALL SOLICITED ADVERSE EVENTS WERE MILD (43 [69%] OF 62) OR MODERATE (19 [31%]) AND WERE MORE FREQUENT AFTER THE FIRST DOSE. ONE SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT OF VIRAL PNEUMONITIS WAS REPORTED IN THE 6 G WITH ALGEL GROUP, UNRELATED TO THE VACCINE. SEROCONVERSION RATES (%) WERE 879, 919, AND 828 IN THE 3 G WITH ALGEL-IMDG, 6 G WITH ALGEL-IMDG, AND 6 G WITH ALGEL GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY.

METHODS: PATIENTS WITH KNOWN CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE WHO PRESENTED WITH SUPERIMPOSED COVID-19 (N = 28) BETWEEN 22 APRIL 2020 AND 22 JUNE 2020 WERE STUDIED. SEVENTY-EIGHT CIRRHOTIC PATIENTS WITHOUT COVID-19 WERE INCLUDED ASHISTORICAL CONTROLSFOR COMPARISON. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 28 COVID-19 PATIENTS (TWO WITHOUT CIRRHOSIS, ONE WITH COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS, SIXTEEN WITH ACUTE DECOMPENSATION [AD], AND NINE WITH ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC LIVER FAILURE [ACLF]) WERE INCLUDED. THE ETIOLOGY OF CIRRHOSIS WAS ALCOHOL (N = 9), NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (N = 2), VIRAL (N = 5), AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS (N = 4), AND CRYPTOGENIC CIRRHOSIS (N = 6). THE CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS INCLUDED COMPLICATIONS OF CIRRHOSIS IN 12 (46.2%), RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS IN 3 (11.5%), AND COMBINED COMPLICATIONS OF CIRRHOSIS AND RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS IN 11 (42.3%) PATIENTS. THE MEDIAN HOSPITAL STAY WAS 8 (712) DAYS. THE MORTALITY RATE IN COVID-19 PATIENTS WAS 42.3% (11/26), AS COMPARED WITH 23.1% (18/78) IN THE HISTORICAL CONTROLS (P = 0.077). ALL COVID-19 PATIENTS WITH ACLF (9/9) DIED COMPARED WITH 53.3% (16/30) IN ACLF OF HISTORICAL CONTROLS (P = 0.015).

AIM: THE AIM OF THIS SURVEY WAS TO EVALUATE THE PATTERN OF CARE OF GYNAECOLOGIC CANCERS IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. METHODS: AN ANONYMOUS SURVEY CONSISTING OF 20 QUESTIONS INTENDED FOR THE GYNAECOLOGIC CANCER CARE PROVIDERS WITH EMPHASIS ON THEIR CURRENT PRACTICE AND APPROACH TO THEIR PATIENTS WAS DISTRIBUTED ONLINE VIA SOCIAL MEDIA FROM APRIL 30 TO MAY 31, 2020. BASIC DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE APPLIED. RESULTS: AMONG A TOTAL OF 61 RESPONDENTS, 63.9% WERE GYNAECOLOGIC ONCOLOGISTS, 18.0% WERE RADIATION ONCOLOGISTS AND 18.0% WERE MEDICAL ONCOLOGISTS. MAJORITY, THAT IS, 95.1% HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS FELT THAT COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE ON THEIR PRACTICE PATTERN AND 56.2% PRACTITIONERS HAD STOPPED REGISTERING NEW CASES OF CANCER. IN 75.4% CENTERS SURGERY WAS BEING DONE FOR GYNAECOLOGIC CANCER CASES AND AMONG THEM 60.8% WERE DOING SURGERY ONLY FOR CASES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION. AMONG THE CENTERS PROVIDING CHEMOTHERAPY, 39.1% HAD SWITCHED TO ORAL DRUGS. AMONG THE CENTERS PROVIDING RADIATION, 40.9% WERE PROVIDING RADIATION TO CASES BASED ON THEIR TYPE AND URGENCY AND 9.0% HAD IMPLEMENTED HYPOFRACTIONATION. IN EARLY STAGE LOW RISK CASES, MAJORITY, THAT IS, 34.0% CENTERS WERE MANAGING AS BEFORE. IN EARLY STAGE HIGH-RISK CASES, 32.6% CENTERS WERE MANAGING AS BEFORE. IN ADVANCED STAGE ENDOMETRIAL CANCER CASES, 28.8% HAD POSTPONED ANY TREATMENT AND 28.8% ADMINISTERED CHEMOTHERAPY. IN EARLY STAGE, EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER 65.9% CENTERS WERE PERFORMING COMPLETE STAGING OF THE DISEASE. IN ADVANCED STAGE EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER, 65.9% CENTERS PREFERRED BIOPSY FOLLOWED BY NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY AND 11.3% CENTERS PERFORMED PRIMARY DEBULKING SURGERY. IN CASES OF INTERVAL DEBULKING SURGERY, 73.3% CENTERS DEFERRED SURGERY TILL ALL SIX CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY WAS COMPLETED. IN CASES OF RECURRENT OVARIAN CANCER AMENABLE FOR SECONDARY DEBULKING SURGERY, 38.6% PREFERRED CHEMOTHERAPY. IN EARLY STAGE CERVICAL CANCER, SURGICAL TREATMENT WAS PROVIDED IN 46.5% CENTERS. IN LOCALLY ADVANCED CERVICAL CANCER, CHEMORADIATION WAS GIVEN IN 65.9% CENTERS. IN CASES OF METASTATIC CERVICAL CANCER, 46.6% CENTERS WERE PERFORMING PALLIATIVE RADIATION.

OBJECTIVE: WE AIM TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS LEVELS IN THE INDIAN POPULATION DUE TO COVID-19 AND TO FIND OUT THE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS WHICH NEED MORE ATTENTION FOR THE PREVENTION OF MENTAL ILLNESS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED THROUGH PROLIFERATIVE APPROACH WITH AID OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND AN ONLINE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT COVID-19, QUALITY OF LIFE (WHQOL), DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS SCALE (DASS-21). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS BY SPSS-2 WAS DONE AND UNPAIRED T-TEST WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE INFLUENCE OF LOCKDOWN ON QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN THE PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: 847 PARTICIPANTS FILLED THE QUESTIONNAIRE 64.1% PARTICIPANTS HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE AND 35.9% HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT COVID-19. WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE WHOQOL & DASS-21 BETWEEN THE MALE AND FEMALE PARTICIPANTS (P=0.0001) AND AGE (18-39 YEARS & 40-64 YEARS) (P=0.0001).

HOWEVER, WITH BREAKTHROUGHS STILL EVOLVING ABOUT THIS DISEASE, THE CALLS ARE NOW LOUDER FOR CLOSER EXAMINATION ON THE PATHOGENESIS OF CONJUNCTIVITIS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. HENCE, WE CONDUCTED A SCOPING REVIEW OF ALL AVAILABLE LITERATURE TILL DATE TO FILL IN THE POTENTIAL GAPS IN CURRENTLY AVAILABLE KNOWLEDGE ON OCULAR MANIFESTATIONS OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH CONTINUITY IN THE CHAIN OF INFORMATION FROM DECEMBER 2019 TILL APRIL 2020.

THE FINDINGS WERE SUMMARIZED USING TEXT, TABLES, DIAGRAMS, AND FLOWCHARTS. RESULTS: THE COMMONEST OCULAR MANIFESTATION IN SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IS FOLLICULAR CONJUNCTIVITIS AND HAS BEEN THE FIRST MANIFESTATION OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IN 3 REPORTED CASES TILL DATE. THE OCULAR SURFACE INOCULATED WITH THE SARS-COV-2 LEADS TO THE FACILITATION OF THE VIRUS TO THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM VIA THE LACRIMAL PASSAGE. RT-PCR ANALYSIS OF THE OCULAR SECRETIONS HAS SHOWN THE PRESENCE OF THE SARS-COV-2 NUCLEOTIDES INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF INFECTION OF OCULAR SECRETIONS. ACE2 RECEPTORS AND ITS EXPRESSION ON THE OCULAR MUCOSAL SURFACE ARE LINKED BEHIND THE ETIOPATHOGENESIS OF CONJUNCTIVITIS.

OUR AIM WAS TO FIND OUT THE CONCERNS OF HCPS WORKING IN NON-COVID AREAS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: AFTER OBTAINING INSTITUTIONAL ETHICS APPROVAL, A DESCRIPTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS PLANNED. AN ONLINE GOOGLE-BASED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ROLLED OUT TO ALL DOCTORS THROUGH VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WHO WERE DEALING WITH COVID-NEGATIVE PATIENTS. RESULTS: WE RECEIVED A TOTAL OF 110 RESPONSES. 84.5% OF PARTICIPANTS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISK OF INFECTION TO SELF AND FAMILY, 67.3% WERE CONCERNED BY THE DISRUPTION OF THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES. 56.4% OF HCPS WERE DISTURBED BY THE LACK OF ANY CONCRETE PROTOCOL FOR PATIENT MANAGEMENT. LESS STAFF AVAILABILITY, DELAY IN DISCHARGING DUTIES TOWARD THEIR PATIENTS, AND INCREASED WORKLOAD WERE OTHER CONCERNS. MORE THAN HALF OF THE DOCTORS RECEIVED N-95 MASKS WHENEVER REQUIRED AND WERE TRAINED IN DONNING AND DOFFING OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. SIXTY-EIGHT PERCEMT OF OUR RESPONDENTS LABELED THEIR CURRENT QUALITY OF LIFE AS STRESSFUL.

METHODS: THIS IS A DESCRIPTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL, QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED, ONLINE SURVEY BY CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. ETHICAL APPROVAL WAS OBTAINED FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW COMMITTEE OF NEPAL HEALTH RESEARCH COUNCIL (REFERENCE NO. 2467). OPEN ACCESS, PRE-VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE USED. PARTICIPANTS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY POOR MENTAL WELLBEING WERE IDENTIFIED USING THE WHO WELL-BEING INDEX THRESHOLD SCORE. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT. RESULTS: FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-SIX PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. FORTY PERCENT OF THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A WHO WELL-BEING INDEX SCORE OF BELOW 13, INDICATIVE OF POOR MENTAL WELLBEING AND A NEED FOR FURTHER ASSESSMENT FOR DEPRESSION.

RECENT STUDIES FROM EUROPE AND USA HAVE REPORTED > 50% REDUCTION IN HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR ACS AND DECLINING RATES OF CORONARY INTERVENTIONS. THE POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS NOTICEABLE REDUCTION IN PATIENTS WITH ACS/STEMI DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ARE MULTI-FACTORIAL.

THREE-FOURTHS (86 [74.8\\%]) OF THE PATIENTS WERE CRITICALLY ILL WHICH FREQUENTLY DELAYED THE DIAGNOSIS OF STROKE. HIGH LEVELS OF D-DIMER, AND FERRITIN WERE OBSERVED IN THESE PATIENTS. PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 AND STROKE HAD A HIGH MORTALITY (47.9\\%). FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH MORTALITY WERE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ADMISSION, HAVING TWO OR MORE VASCULAR RISK FACTORS, PARTICULARLY SMOKING AND HIGH LEVELS OF D-DIMER, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, AND LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE. CONCLUSIONS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN STROKE AND COVID-19 IS PROBABLY MULTIFACTORIAL INCLUDING AN AMALGAMATION OF TRADITIONAL VASCULAR RISK FACTORS, PROINFLAMMATORY AND A PROTHROMBOTIC STATE. PROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED DATA IS REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE TO CONFIRM THIS HYPOTHESIS.","PY":"2020","AU":"BHATIA R;PEDAPATI R;KOMAKULA M;VISHNUBHATLA S;KHURANAC D","TI":"STROKE IN CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","Topic 1":0.0115717520138895,"Topic 2":0.00320039121479901,"Topic 3":0.00248697003540689,"Topic 4":0.00296098112311572,"Topic 5":0.0504299905914427,"Topic 6":0.00156701841709476,"Topic 7":0.842188203122064,"Topic 8":0.0747974515106807,"Topic 9":0.003328862788,"Topic 10":0.00746837918350625},{"id":213,"body":"THE EMERGING INFECTION OF COVID-19 WAS INITIATED FROM WUHAN, CHINA, HAVE BEEN SPREAD TO MORE THAN 210 COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE INCLUDING INDIA.

APPROXIMATELY 710 (28.2\\%) PATIENTS MISSED 1 OR MORE DIALYSIS SESSIONS, 69 (2.74\\%) REQUIRED EMERGENCY DIALYSIS SESSIONS, 104 (4.13\\%) STOPPED REPORTING FOR DIALYSIS, AND 9 (0.36\\%) WERE CONFIRMED TO HAVE DIED. OUTPATIENT ATTENDANCE IN THE SURVEYED HOSPITAL CAME DOWN BY 92.3\\%, AND INPATIENT SERVICE REDUCED BY 61\\%. TELE-CONSULTATION WAS STARTED BUT WAS ACCESSED BY ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: LACK OF PREPAREDNESS BEFORE LOCKDOWN RESULTED IN AN INTERRUPTION IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND POSED AN IMMEDIATE ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE OUTCOME OF DIALYSIS PATIENTS AND PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY DISEASE IN INDIA. THE LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE HEALTH OF PATIENTS WITH LESS SEVERE FORMS OF KIDNEY DISEASE REMAINS UNKNOWN. (C) 2020 INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER INC.

METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE SURVEY WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON PRIOR EVIDENCE AND INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS. IT WAS EMAILED TO THE INDIAN PALLIATIVE CARE ASSOCIATION MEMBERS AND INVESTIGATORS' PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS IN INDIA. ONE PARTICIPANT PER PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICE WAS REQUESTED. DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS WAS USED. RESULTS: REPRESENTATIVES OF 78 PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES COMPLETED THE SURVEY. THREE IN FOUR SERVICES HAD COVID-19 CASE DEFINITION AND ADAPTED THEIR PROTOCOLS FOR INFECTION CONTROL (75%). ABOUT HALF OF THE SERVICES (55%) REPORTED CONCERNS ABOUT ACHIEVING APPROPRIATE HAND HYGIENE IN THE COMMUNITY. MORE THAN HALF OF THE SERVICES (59%) HAD CAPACITY TO TRAIN NONSPECIALISTS FOR SYMPTOM CONTROL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT. ABOUT HALF OF THE SERVICES REPORTED THAT THEY HAD PLANS TO REDEPLOY STAFF (56%) AND RESOURCES (53%) IN THE CASE OF OUTBREAKS. TWO-FIFTHS OF THE SERVICES USED PAPER RECORDS TO STORE AN UPDATED CONTACT LIST OF STAFF (40%) AND DID NOT HAVE DESIGNATED FOCAL CONTACTS FOR INFORMATION UPDATE (40%).

METHODS: DIFFERENT ELECTRONIC DATABASES (MEDLINE, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, CENTRAL, MEDRXIV AND BIORXIV) WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES DESCRIBING PSYCHOLOGICAL/BEHAVIORAL COMPLICATIONS IN CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS WITH/WITHOUT PRE-EXISTING BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES AND THEIR CAREGIVERS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. ONLY ORIGINAL ARTICLES WITH/WITHOUT COMPARATOR ARMS AND A MINIMUM SAMPLE SIZE OF 50 WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE POOLED ESTIMATE OF VARIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL/BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS WAS CALCULATED USING A RANDOM-EFFECT META-ANALYSIS. RESULTS: FIFTEEN STUDIES DESCRIBING 22996 CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS FULFILLED THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FROM A TOTAL OF 219 RECORDS. OVERALL, 34.5%, 41.7%, 42.3% AND 30.8% OF CHILDREN WERE FOUND TO BE SUFFERING FROM ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, IRRITABILITY AND INATTENTION. ALTHOUGH THE BEHAVIOR/PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE OF A TOTAL OF 79.4% OF CHILDREN WAS AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY THE PANDEMIC AND QUARANTINE, AT LEAST 22.5% OF CHILDREN HAD A SIGNIFICANT FEAR OF COVID-19, AND 35.2% AND 21.3% OF CHILDREN HAD BOREDOM AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE.

NHCW WERE FURTHER CATEGORIZED INTO RESIDENTS OF CONTAINMENT AND NON-CONTAINMENT ZONES AND SEROPREVALENCE ANALYZED. SEROPREVALENCE AMONG DIFFERENT ABO BLOOD GROUPS WAS ALSO ANALYZED. RESULTS: 1191 BLOOD DONORS WERE TESTED FOR SARS-COV-2 ANTIBODIES WITH 9.5 % SEROPOSITIVITY. SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SEROPOSITIVITY OF 3.2 % (P < 0.001) WAS OBSERVED AMONG HCW AS COMPARED TO 10.9 % SEROPOSITIVITY IN NHCW.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY HAS CREATED UNFORESEEN PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES INCLUDING A GLOBAL SHORTAGE OF PPE NEEDED FOR THE SAFETY OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS (HCWS). ALTHOUGH SUFFICIENT STOCKS OF PPE ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, THEIR CRITICAL SHORTAGE MAY DEVELOP SOON DUE TO INCREASE IN DEMAND AND DEPLETION OF EXISTING SUPPLY LINES. TO EMPOWER OUR HCWS AND ENSURE THEIR CONTINUED PROTECTION, PROACTIVE MEASURES ARE URGENTLY REQUIRED TO DEVELOP PROCEDURES TO SAFELY DECONTAMINATE THE PPES TO ALLOW THEIR ``SELECTIVE REUSE'' DURING CONTINGENCY SITUATIONS. METHODS HEREIN, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED A DECONTAMINATION METHOD BASED ON VAPORIZED HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (VHP). WE HAVE USED A RANGE OF CONCENTRATION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE TO DISINFECT PPE (COVERALLS, FACE-SHIELDS, AND N-95 MASKS). TO ENSURE A PROPER DISINFECTION, WE HAVE EVALUATED THREE BIOLOGICAL INDICATORS NAMELYESCHERICHIA COLI,MYCOBACTERIUM SMEGMATISAND SPORES OFBACILLUS STEAROTHERMOPHILUS, CONSIDERED AS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR DISINFECTION PROCESSES. WE NEXT EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF REPEATED VHP TREATMENT ON PHYSICAL FEATURES, PERMEABILITY, AND FABRIC INTEGRITY OF COVERALLS AND N-95 MASKS. NEXT, WE PERFORMED SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM) TO EVALUATE MICROSCOPIC CHANGES IN FIBER THICKNESS OF N-95 MASKS, MELT BLOWN LAYER OR COVERALL BODY SUITS. CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT ANY DISINFECTION PROCEDURE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MEET LOCAL REQUIREMENTS, OUR STUDY INCLUDED VARIOUS REGIONALLY PROCURED N-95 MASKS AND COVERALLS AVAILABLE AT OUR INSTITUTE AIIMS (AIIMS), NEW DELHI, INDIA. LASTLY, THE PRACTICAL UTILITY OF VHP METHOD DEVELOPED HEREIN WAS ASCERTAINED BY OPERATIONALIZING A DEDICATED RESEARCH FACILITY DISINFECTING USED PPE DURING COVID-19. RESULTS OUR PROTOTYPE STUDIES SHOW THAT A SINGLE VHP CYCLE (7-8\\% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE) COULD DISINFECT PPE AND PPE HOUSING ROOM OF ABOUT 1200 CUBIC FEET (LENGTH10 FT X BREADTH 10 FT X HEIGHT 12 FT) IN LESS THAN 10 MIN, AS NOTED BY A COMPLETE LOSS OFB. STEAROTHERMOPHILUSSPORE REVIVAL. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT AND REPRODUCIBLE AS TESTED IN OVER 10 CYCLES IN OUR SETTINGS. FURTHER, REPEATED VHP TREATMENT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY PHYSICAL TEAR, DEFORMITY OR OTHER APPRECIABLE CHANGE IN THE COVERALL AND N-95 MASKS. OUR PERMEATION TESTS EVALUATING DROPLET PENETRATION DID NOT REVEAL ANY CHANGE IN PERMEABILITY POST-VHP TREATMENTS. ALSO, SEM ANALYSIS INDEED REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN FIBER THICKNESS OR DAMAGE TO FIBERS OF COVERALLS OR MELT BLOWN LAYER OF N-95 MASKS ESSENTIAL FOR FILTRATION. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN USER COMFORT AND EXPERIENCE FOLLOWING VHP TREATMENT OF PPE. BASED ON RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES, AND PARAMETERS DEVELOPED AND OPTIMIZED, AN INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH FACILITY TO DISINFECT COVID-19 PPE IS SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHED AND OPERATIONALIZED WITH MORE THAN 80\\% RECOVERY RATE FOR USED PPE POST-DISINFECTION. CONCLUSIONS OUR STUDY, THEREFORE, SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHES THE UTILITY OF VHP TO EFFECTIVELY DISINFECT PPE FOR A POSSIBLE REUSE AS PER THE REQUIREMENTS. VHP TREATMENT DID NOT DAMAGE COVERALLS, CAUSE PHYSICAL DEFORMITY AND ALSO DID NOT ALTER FABRIC ARCHITECTURE OF MELT BLOWN LAYER. WE OBSERVED THAT DISINFECTION PROCESS WAS SUCCESSFUL CONSISTENTLY AND THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT THE VHP-BASED DECONTAMINATION MODEL WILL HAVE A UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY AND UTILITY. THIS PROCESS CAN BE EASILY AND ECONOMICALLY SCALED UP AND CAN BE INSTRUMENTAL IN EASING GLOBAL PPE SHORTAGES IN ANY BIOSAFETY FACILITY OR IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS DURING PANDEMIC SITUATION SUCH AS COVID-19.","PY":"2020","AU":"SAINI V;SIKRI K;BATRA S;KALRA P;GAUTAM K","TI":"DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE LOWCOST VAPORIZED HYDROGEN PEROXIDEBASED METHOD FOR DISINFECTION OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR THEIR SELECTIVE REUSE DURING PANDEMICS","Topic 1":0.000989736682651274,"Topic 2":0.000403530226925303,"Topic 3":0.00354021463574623,"Topic 4":0.0269721670175643,"Topic 5":0.066473260198811,"Topic 6":0.00337807746813358,"Topic 7":0.0018529651918995,"Topic 8":0.00285816596721176,"Topic 9":0.00525599999274478,"Topic 10":0.888275882618312},{"id":265,"body":"SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS-2 IS A POSITIVE-SENSE RNA VIRUS, A CAUSAL AGENT OF ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SURVEY WAS TO ANALYZE THE CHANGE IN NEUROSURGICAL PRACTICE IN INDIA FOLLOWING THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK AND ASSESS ITS IMPACT ON PRACTISING NEUROSURGEONS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BETWEEN MAY 7TH AND 23RD, 2020, A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CIRCULATED AMONGST PRACTISING NEUROSURGEONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BY SOCIAL MEDIA AND E-MAILS, REGARDING CHANGES IN THE PATTERNS OF PATIENTS SEEN, ADAPTATIONS MADE IN THEIR PRACTICE, EFFECT ON SURGERIES PERFORMED, FINANCIAL BURDEN, AND IMPACT ON THEIR PERSONAL LIVES. THE RESPONSES WERE KEPT ANONYMOUS AND WERE ANALYZED FOR CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE CHANGES OBSERVED AND INDEPENDENT FACTORS SUCH AS HOSPITAL AFFILIATIONS, TEACHING PROFESSIONS, AND NEUROSURGICAL EXPERIENCE. RESULTS: OUR SURVEY SHOWED A DRASTIC FALL IN THE NUMBER OF NEUROSURGICAL PATIENTS SEEN IN THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT (OPD) AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF SURGERIES PERFORMED. A DROP OF 76.25% WAS SEEN IN OPD PATIENTS (P = 0.000) AND THAT OF 70.59% IN SURGERIES PERFORMED (P = 0.000). THERE WAS NO UNIFORMITY AMONG THE NEUROSURGEONS IN THE NUMBER OF COVID-19 TESTS BEING DONE BEFORE ELECTIVE/EMERGENCY SURGERY AND IN THE USE OF PROTECTIVE GEAR WHILE EXAMINING PATIENTS.

THE LOCKDOWN WAS EMPLOYED TO DELAY THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER, IT HAD AN UNINTENTIONAL IMPACT ON ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR CARE, ESPECIALLY ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI). OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A DECREASE IN HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR AMI IN SEVERAL DEVELOPED COUNTRIES DURING THE PANDEMIC PERIOD. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE AMI ADMISSIONS PATTERNS ACROSS INDIA. METHODS: IN THIS MULTICENTRIC, RETROSPECTIVE, CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY, WE INCLUDED ALL AMI CASES ADMITTED TO PARTICIPATING HOSPITALS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD 15TH MARCH TO 15TH JUNE 2020 AND COMPARED THEM USING A HISTORICAL CONTROL OF ALL CASES OF AMI ADMITTED DURING THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN THE YEAR 2019. MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO ANALYZE THE CHANGES INTHE NUMBER OF HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR AMI IN HOSPITALS ACROSS INDIA. IN ADDITION, WE INTEND TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE WEEKLY AMI ADMISSION RATES, AND OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURES LIKE RATES OF THROMBOLYSIS/PRIMARY PERCUTANEOUS INTERVENTIONS (PCI), WINDOW PERIOD, DOOR TO BALLOON TIME, AND DOOR TO NEEDLE TIME. OTHER OBJECTIVES INCLUDE EVALUATION OF CHANGES IN THE MAJOR COMPLICATIONS AND MORTALITY RATES OF AMI AND ITS PREDICTORS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

A FIXED-EFFECT MODEL WAS APPLIED IFI(2) < 50\\%, ELSE RESULTS WERE COMBINED USING RANDOM-EFFECT MODEL. RISK RATIO (RR) OR STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) ALONG WITH 95\\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (95\\% CI) WAS USED TO POOL THE RESULTS. BETWEEN-STUDY HETEROGENEITY WAS EXPLORED USING INFLUENCE AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES, AND PUBLICATION BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING FUNNEL PLOTS. ENTIRE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED IN R VERSION 3.6.2. RESULTS: FIFTY STUDIES INVOLVING 15 IN VITRO AND 35 CLINICAL STUDIES INCLUDING 9170 NCOV-2019 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. LOPINAVIR-RITONAVIR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH SHORTER MEAN TIME TO CLINICAL RECOVERY (SMD -0.32; 95\\% CI -0.57 TO -0.06), REMDESIVIR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER OVERALL CLINICAL RECOVERY (RR 1.17; 95\\% CI 1.07 TO 1.29), AND TOCILIZUMAB WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LESS ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY (RR 0.38; 95\\% CI 0.16 TO 0.93). HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LONGER TIME TO CLINICAL RECOVERY AND LESS OVERALL CLINICAL RECOVERY. IT ADDITIONALLY HAD HIGHER ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY AND MORE TOTAL ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSION: OUR META-ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT EXCEPT IN VITRO STUDIES, NO TREATMENT HAS SHOWN OVERALL FAVOURABLE OUTCOMES IN NCOV-2019 PATIENTS. LOPINAVIR-RITONAVIR, REMDESIVIR AND TOCILIZUMAB MAY HAVE SOME BENEFITS, WHILE HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE ADMINISTRATION MAY CAUSE HARM IN NCOV-2019 PATIENTS.

FEW PUBLISHED STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THESE DRUGS IN THE TREATMENT OF COVID-19 INFECTION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS IS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES. MAJOR DATABASE SEARCHES WERE CARRIED OUT UP UNTIL JUNE 5, 2020. PARTICIPANTS ADMITTED WITH RT-PCR-CONFIRMED SARS COV-2 (COVID-19) INFECTION WERE INCLUDED. THE ``INTERVENTION GROUP'' RECEIVED ANTI-MALARIAL DRUGS WITH OR WITHOUT OTHER DRUGS (AZITHROMYCIN) ADMINISTERED AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE STANDARD TREATMENT/CARE. THE ``CONTROL GROUP'' RECEIVED TREATMENT EXCEPT ANTI-MALARIAL DRUGS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS ``ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY.'' SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE EFFECTS ON CLINICAL AND LABORATORY PARAMETERS AND ADVERSE EVENTS. RESULTS: OF 3,472 CITATIONS, 17 (SIX CLINICAL TRIALS AND 11 OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES) STUDIES PROVIDED DATA OF 8,071 PARTICIPANTS. COMPARED TO THE CONTROL, HYDROXY-CHLOROQUINE (HCQ) HAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON MORTALITY [(OR 0.87; 95\\% CI 0.46-1.64); EIGHT OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES; N = 5,944]. DATA FROM A SINGLE, SMALL NON-RANDOMIZED TRIAL (N = 42) ALSO REACHED A SIMILAR CONCLUSION (OR 1.94; 95\\% CI 0.07-50.57; P = 0.69). COMPARED TO THE CONTROL, HCQ PLUS AZITHROMYCIN (AZM) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED MORTALITY [(OR 2.84; 95\\% CI 2.19-3.69); FOUR OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES; N = 2,310]. COMPARED TO THE CONTROL, RISK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN HCQ GROUP [(OR 3.35; 95\\% CI 1.58-7.13); FOUR CLINICAL TRIALS; N = 263]. COMPARED TO CONTROL, RISK OF ADVERSE CARDIAC EVENTS (ABNORMAL ECG, ARRHYTHMIA, OR QT PROLONGATION) WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN HCQ GROUP (BUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN THE HCQ PLUS AZM GROUP). THE GRADE EVIDENCE GENERATED FOR ALL THE OUTCOMES WAS OF ``VERY LOW-QUALITY.'' CONCLUSIONS: AS VERY LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS AN INCREASED RISK OF MORTALITY AND ADVERSE EVENT WITH HCQ PLUS AZITHROMYCIN COMBINATION (NOT HCQ ALONE), CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHILE PRESCRIBING THIS COMBINATION FOR TREATMENT OF HOSPITALIZED ADULTS WITH COVID-19 INFECTION. GOOD QUALITY, MULTI-CENTRIC RCTS (INCLUDING BOTH HOSPITALIZED AND NON-HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS) ARE REQUIRED FOR ANY FIRM RECOMMENDATION TO BE MADE DURING THE ONGOING PANDEMIC.","PY":"2020","AU":"DAS R;JAISWAL N;DEV N;JAISWAL N;NAIK S;SANKAR J","TI":"EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF ANTIMALARIAL DRUGS CHLOROQUINE AND HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE IN TREATMENT OF COVID19 INFECTION A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND METAANALYSIS","Topic 1":0.0208326534389481,"Topic 2":0.553228366393821,"Topic 3":0.0039538992742139,"Topic 4":0.000897341553376704,"Topic 5":0.229483197756111,"Topic 6":0.00889273867053052,"Topic 7":0.0185966879135401,"Topic 8":0.142669273961632,"Topic 9":0.0117705392431896,"Topic 10":0.00967530179463768},{"id":318,"body":"THE BURDEN AND IMPACT OF SECONDARY SUPERADDED INFECTIONS IN CRITICALLY ILL CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PATIENTS IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED.

SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES HAVE BEEN DEDICATED TO THE DISEASE. THE PANDEMIC IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT, COMPARED WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD, IS RELATIVELY DELAYED. THE NEUROSURGICAL PRACTICE CANNOT REMAIN UNAFFECTED BY HUGELY DISRUPTIVE MEASURES SUCH AS A LOCKDOWN. THE INEVITABLE INCREASE IN COVID INFECTIONS WITH THE GRADUAL RELAXATION OF LOCKDOWN CONTINUES TO POSE A RISK FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD A DISCERNIBLE EFFECT ON HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF PRACTICE MODIFICATIONS IN PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS AND PUBLICLY FUNDED HOSPITALS, THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT ON THE SURGEON, AND THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON THE PSYCHE OF THE SURGEON. METHODS: AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY WAS PREPARED, WITH QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE COVID-SPECIFIC THEMES OF PRECAUTIONS TAKEN IN OUTPATIENT SERVICES AND OPERATING THEATERS, THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, THE ECONOMIC LOSS INCURRED, AND THE PERCEPTIBLE IMPACT OF TELEMEDICINE AND WEBINARS. THE LINKS TO THE SURVEY WERE MAILED TO NEUROSURGEONS IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PRACTICE COUNTRYWIDE. THE RESPONSES WERE ANONYMIZED TO ENSURE FREE AND UNBIASED ANSWERS TO THE SURVEY QUESTIONS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 176 RESPONSES WERE RECEIVED FROM ACROSS THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT. THE MEDIAN AGE OF RESPONDENTS WAS 39 YEARS (RANGE, 32-70 YEARS) AND THE POST-RESIDENCY EXPERIENCE WAS 7 YEARS (RANGE, 0-34 YEARS). RESPONDENTS WERE AN EQUITABLE MIX OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PRACTITIONERS. OF RESPONDENTS, 46\\% WERE PRACTICING RESTRICTED OUTPATIENT SERVICES, MORE IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS (P = 0.22) WHICH ALSO HAD A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF TELE-OUTPATIENT SERVICES (26\\% VS. 17\\%). WEARING SURGICAL MASKS, N95 MASKS, AND GLOVES WERE THE MOST COMMONLY PRACTICED PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES IN OUTPATIENT SERVICES (>60\\%). ALTHOUGH PRIVATE PRACTITIONERS WERE CONTINUING ELECTIVE CASES (40\\%), PUBLIC INSTITUTES WERE MORE CAUTIOUS, WITH ONLY EMERGENCY PATIENTS BEING OPERATED ON (29\\%). THE GREATEST FEAR AMONG ALL PRACTITIONERS WAS PASSING THE INFECTION TO THEIR FAMILY (75\\%). SOCIAL MEDIA WERE HELPFUL FOR BRAINSTORMING QUERIES AND UPDATING PRACTICE MODIFICATIONS, BUT SOME SURGEONS ADMITTED TO RECEIVING THREATS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (37.5\\%).

IN THIS REVIEW, WE DISSECT THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE PROPHYLAXIS FROM A CLINICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW. IN VITRO STUDIES ON VERO CELLS SHOW THAT HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE EFFECTIVELY INHIBITS SARS-COV-2 BY AFFECTING VIRAL ENTRY AND VIRAL TRANSPORT VIA ENDOLYSOSOMES. HOWEVER, THIS EFFICACY HAS FAILED TO REPLICATE IN IN VIVO ANIMAL MODELS AS WELL AS IN MOST CLINICAL OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS ASSESSING PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS AND POSTEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS IN HEALTHCARE WORKERS. AN ANALYSIS OF THE PHARMACOLOGY OF HCQ IN COVID-19 REVEALS CERTAIN POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS FAILURE-A PHARMACOKINETIC FAILURE DUE TO FAILURE TO ACHIEVE ADEQUATE DRUG CONCENTRATION AT THE TARGET SITE AND ATTENUATION OF ITS INHIBITORY EFFECT DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF TMPRSS2 IN AIRWAY EPITHELIAL CELLS. CURRENTLY, MANY CLINICAL TRIALS ON HCQ PROPHYLAXIS IN HCW ARE ONGOING; THESE FACTORS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

THE LONG INCUBATION PERIOD, HIGH INFECTIOUS RATE, VARIED MANIFESTATION, AND ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE TREATMENT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE DISEASE TRANSMISSION. OBJECTIVE: THE INTENDED GOALS ARE TO ENCOURAGE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF NEUROLOGICAL AND NEUROSURGICAL PATIENTS, RESOURCE UTILIZATION, AND PROTECTING THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER DURING THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC. HEREIN, WE PRESENT A CONSENSUS STATEMENT FROM VARIOUS CENTERS IN INDIA METHODOLOGY: IN ADDITION TO THE LITERATURE REVIEW, RECOMMENDATIONS WERE INCLUDED FROM NEUROLOGISTS AND NEUROSURGEONS FROM VARIOUS CENTERS IN INDIA. RESULTS: EVERY PATIENT PRESENTING FOR TREATMENT SHOULD BE TREATED AS A POTENTIAL ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTED CASE. PATIENTS SHOULD BE CATEGORIZED BASED UPON THE PRIORITY AS ACUTE (REQUIRE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT/SURGERY WITHIN 24 H), SUB-ACUTE (REQUIRING TREATMENT WITHIN A MAXIMUM OF 7-10 DAYS), OR CHRONIC (REQUIRING TREATMENT WITHIN A MONTH). NON-ESSENTIAL ELECTIVE SURGERIES AND OUTPATIENT CLINICS SHOULD BE AVOIDED AFTER INFORMING THE PATIENT(S). THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF AEROSOL DISPERSION DURING INTUBATION AND CERTAIN NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVING DRILLS AND ENDOSCOPES. THESE PROCEDURES SHOULD BE PERFORMED WEARING FULL PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. THE WORKFLOW OF THE OPERATING ROOMS SHOULD ALSO BE MODIFIED SIGNIFICANTLY. MINOR MODIFICATIONS IN PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIFESTYLES AND ROUTINE TRAINING TO USE THE PPE WILL ENSURE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES.

METHODS WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH FROM THE PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, EMBASE, AND WHO DATABASES FOR STUDIES MENTIONING THE CHEST CT IMAGING FINDINGS OF ADULT COVID-19 PATIENTS. RESULTS A TOTAL OF 45 STUDIES COMPRISING 4410 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. GROUND GLASS OPACITIES (GGO), IN ISOLATION (50.2\\%) OR COEXISTING WITH CONSOLIDATIONS (44.2\\%), WERE THE MOST COMMON LESIONS. DISTRIBUTION OF GGOS WAS MOST COMMONLY BILATERAL, PERIPHERAL/SUBPLEURAL, AND POSTERIOR WITH PREDILECTION FOR LOWER LOBES. COMMON ANCILLARY FINDINGS INCLUDED PULMONARY VASCULAR ENLARGEMENT (64\\%), INTRALOBULAR SEPTAL THICKENING (60\\%), ADJACENT PLEURAL THICKENING (41.7\\%), AIR BRONCHOGRAMS (41.2\\%), SUBPLEURAL LINES, CRAZY PAVING, BRONCHUS DISTORTION, BRONCHIECTASIS, AND INTERLOBULAR SEPTAL THICKENING. CT IN EARLY FOLLOW-UP PERIOD GENERALLY SHOWED AN INCREASE IN SIZE, NUMBER, AND DENSITY OF GGOS, WITH PROGRESSION INTO MIXED AREAS OF GGOS PLUS CONSOLIDATIONS AND CRAZY PAVING, PEAKING AT 10-11 DAYS, BEFORE GRADUALLY RESOLVING OR PERSISTING AS PATCHY FIBROSIS. WHILE YOUNGER ADULTS MORE COMMONLY HAD GGOS, EXTENSIVE/MULTILOBAR INVOLVEMENT WITH CONSOLIDATIONS WAS PREVALENT IN THE OLDER POPULATION AND THOSE WITH SEVERE DISEASE. CONCLUSION THIS REVIEW DESCRIBES THE IMAGING FEATURES FOR DIAGNOSIS, STRATIFICATION, AND FOLLOW-UP OF COVID-19 PATIENTS. THE MOST COMMON CT MANIFESTATIONS ARE BILATERAL, PERIPHERAL/SUBPLEURAL, POSTERIOR GGOS WITH OR WITHOUT CONSOLIDATIONS WITH A LOWER LOBE PREDOMINANCE.
